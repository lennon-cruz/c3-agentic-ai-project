# Project Rubric — Agentic AI (UdaPlay)

Use this project rubric to understand and assess the project criteria.

## RAG

| Criteria | Submission Requirements |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Prepare and process a local dataset of video game information for use in a vector database and RAG pipeline | • The submission includes the notebook (*Udaplay_01_solution_project.ipynb*) that loads, processes, and formats the provided game JSON files.<br>• The processed data is added to a persistent vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) with appropriate embeddings.<br>• The notebook or script demonstrates that the vector database can be queried for semantic search. |

## Agent Development

### 1. Implement agent tools for internal retrieval, evaluation, and web search fallback.

**Submission Requirements:**

- The submission includes at least three tools:
  - A tool to retrieve game information from the vector database.
  - A tool to evaluate the quality of retrieved results.
  - A tool to perform web search using an API (e.g., Tavily).
- Each tool is implemented as a function/class and is integrated into the agent workflow.
- The agent:
  - first attempts to answer using internal knowledge,
  - evaluates the result,
  - and falls back to web search if needed.

---

### 2. Build a stateful agent that manages conversation and tool usage.

**Submission Requirements:**

- The agent is implemented as a class or function that maintains conversation state.
- The agent can handle multiple queries in a session, remembering previous context.
- The agent's workflow is implemented as a state machine or similar abstraction.
- The agent produces clear, structured, and well-cited answers.

---

### 3. Demonstrate and report on the agent's performance with example queries.

**Submission Requirements:**

- The submission includes the notebook (*Udaplay_02_solution_project.ipynb*) that runs the agent on at least three example queries (e.g., about game release dates, platforms, or publishers).
- The output for each query includes the agent's reasoning, tool usage, and final answer.
- The report includes at least the response with citation, if any.

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out

- **Personalize the Dataset:** Add extra games, companies, or platforms to the dataset and demonstrate richer queries.
- **Advanced Memory:** Implement persistent long-term memory so the agent "learns" from web searches.
- **Structured Output:** Return answers in both natural language and structured JSON for easy integration.
- **Visualization:** Create a dashboard or visualization of the agent's retrieval process or knowledge base.
- **Custom Tools:** Add extra tools, such as sentiment analysis of game reviews or trending games detection.
